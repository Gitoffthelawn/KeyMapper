Key Mapper 3.0 is here! 🎉

🫧 This release introduces Floating Buttons: you can create custom on-screen buttons to trigger key maps.
🔦 You can now change the flashlight brightness. Tip: use the constraint for when the flashlight is showing to remap your volume buttons to change the brightness.
❤️ There are also tonnes of improvements to make your key mapping experience more enjoyable.

👀 Grouping key maps into folders with shared constraints are a work in progress. This will be free for everyone!
